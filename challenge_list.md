### Challange list

1. What the numbers? | https://github.com/superbestdevelopmentfriends/what_the_numbers.git
   
   a. Imagine a safe, it probably has some really cool stuff in it. Like money and... money and things. Luckily it's your safe so you know exactly what cool stuff is in it.
   Unfortunately the passcode safe you kept the key in is corrupt and the bloody thing is corrupted. Luckily, google reckons you're not the first one to experience this,
   grab the corrupted passcode file and take the first and last number of each line, add them all up and voila, that should be your passcode.
