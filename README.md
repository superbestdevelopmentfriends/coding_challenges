# coding_challenges

I did a bit of research and it looks like having multiple projects in one repo is a ballache so if you close this repo it'll be a way to track any challenges that are upload.

Check out the challenge list and if you find one you want to try, follow these steps;
  
  1. Make sure you have git installed
  2. Create a folder for all of your challenges to go (e.g. /home/user/Documents/code/)
  3. Clone this git (git clone https://github.com/superbestdevelopmentfriends/coding_challenges.git)
  4. Branch the git (git branch branch_name)
  5. Solve the problem in any language you like and once complete
  6. git add <new files>
  7. git pull 
  7. Pick a challenge and jump to your original folder (/home/user/Documents/code) and then
